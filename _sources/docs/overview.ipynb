    "\n",
    "This package is a collection of tools to display and analyze 2D and 2D time-lapse microscopy images. In particular it makes it straightforward to create figures containing multi-channel images represented in a *composite* color mode as done in the popular image processing software [Fiji](https://imagej.net/software/fiji/). It also allows to easily complete such figures with standard annotations like **labels** and **scale bars**. In case of time-lapse data, the figures are turned into **animations** which can be interactively browsed from a Jupyter notebook, saved in standard movie formats (mp4, gif etc.) and completed with **time counters**. Finally, figures and animations can easily be combined into larger **panels**. These main functionalities are provided by the ```microfilm.microplot``` and ```microfilm.microanim``` modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the model of [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html), ```microfilm``` is entirely based on [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and tries to provide good defaults to produce good microcopy figures *out-of-the-box*. It however also offers complete access to the Matplotlib structures like axis and figures underlying the ```microfilm``` objects, allowing thus for the creation of arbitrarily complex plots."
